Just a collection of tools and scripts, eventually I'll get them to interact with eatchother a bit better.
For example the next goal is to get all my parsers to parse the output of tools and give you the option of inserting 
them directly into your obsidian notebook.

to build each project you'll want to have rust installed on your computer, I personally recommend using rustup according to the instructions [[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/insall|here]] once you have that installed and a default toolkit selected you should be able to just use cargo to compile these.  I've only really tested most of them on linux but they might work for windows as well.
