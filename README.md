# random-pentest-scripts-and-tools\
Just a collection of tools and scripts, eventually I'll get them to interact with eatchother a bit better.
For example the next goal is to get all my parsers to parse the output of tools and give you the option of inserting 
them directly into your obsidian notebook.
